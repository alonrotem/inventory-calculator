✅ L1 can split to up to 4 sub-babies (same length)
✅ Crown area can be 1-3 cm (steps 0.5 cm)
✅ Individual crown babies lengths

✅ Let customer set diameter of the hat (12 3/4" - 16", steps 1/2")
✅  1. Calculate the circomference -> diameter * pi
✅  2. reduce the circomference by 1 cm
✅  3. divide the results by crown area length -> number of wings in the hat.
✅   * customer can't set or change number of wings in the hat
✅   * Measures up to 3 decimal places
